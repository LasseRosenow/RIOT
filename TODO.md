# TODO

- namespaces are predefined as enums, but can be set to a struct that is then this namespace?
- sys namespace struct with fields pointing to each sys schema
- schema contains fields that contain functions for set get commit export

- make registry_path optional and move it outside registry_core
  - if a storage facility needs paths, make path a requirement of that storage facility
